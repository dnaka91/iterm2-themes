# iTerm2 themes

My personal (very short) collection of color themes for iTerm2.

## [One Dark Pro](themes/OneDarkPro.itermcolors)

A custom theme with colors extracted from the [VS Code One Dark Pro][vscode-odp] plugin.

## [One Half Dark](themes/OneHalfDark.itermcolors)

Copied from the [iTerm2 Color Schemes][github-ics] repo and just here as a backup.
